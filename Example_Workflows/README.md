# Example ESFS workflows

Here we provide some example ESFS workflows for users to follow. During development these are subject to change. 

The Delile2019 and Radley2024 are in good shape (will be cleaned up a bit but hopefully they are good enough for new users to understand how to apply ESFS to their own data). Data will be provided in a Mendely repository with the paper, but that's not ready yet. Can provide initial data if needed, but hopefully you can reporpose these workflows for data you are interested in.

Feedback welcome.
